<h3>Tree Locator</h3>
<p>The idea here is to try to find the trees closest to you or the location you enter.</p>

<form (ngSubmit)="submitForm($event)" novalidate>
  <input type="text" (ngModel)="postalCode" placeholder="Enter Location" />
  <button type="submit">Find</button>
</form>

<div>
  <tree-table [trees]="trees"></tree-table>
</div>
