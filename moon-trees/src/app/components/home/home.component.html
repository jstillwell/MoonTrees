<h1>Moon Trees</h1>
<p>
  What is a moon tree? The short story is that they are seeds that were taken on Apollo 14.
  They never touched the moon but did orbit it. Later they were germenated and nearly all were viable.
  They were given out to various institutions and planted. The story is interesting and you can learn more at the links below.

  There are even second generation moon trees. This means simply that those trees come from seed or cuttings of the originals.
